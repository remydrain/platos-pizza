# Plato's Pizza

Using data from the [Maven Analytics Pizza Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-pizza-challenge/4), I'll be analyzing a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place to help them drive more sales and work more efficiently.

## Questions to Answer

* What days and times tend to be busiest?
* How many pizzas are being made during peak periods?
* What are their best and worst selling pizzas?
* What is the average order value?
* How well are they using their seating capacity?
